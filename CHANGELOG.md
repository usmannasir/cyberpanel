## v2.4.8 (build 8) — 2026-05-30

A panel-wide UI/UX overhaul focused on making CyberPanel easier to use, calmer
to look at, and faster — plus integrated development services. See
`docs/UI-Guide.md` for a full walkthrough.

### Navigation & information architecture
- Replaced the deep, nested sidebar with a short, **flat, object-based
  navigation** grouped into Hosting / Account / Administration / Help — no more
  accordions.
- Added category **hub pages** (Email, Databases & FTP, Backups, Users & Plans,
  Server, Security, Settings): each area's tools shown as a scannable grid of
  labelled, permission-aware tiles.
- Added a global **command palette** (`Ctrl/⌘-K`) that searches every page and
  common action, including a searchable "Build services" group.
- New per-site **Site Workspace** (`/websites/<domain>/workspace`) gathering
  files, SSL, DNS, email, databases, backups and advanced tools for one domain.

### Dashboard
- Action-first dashboard: quick actions and a getting-started checklist for new
  installs, with the health metrics and activity board retained.

### Site management page
- Reorganized the long single-scroll site page into **tabs** (Overview /
  Domains / Logs / Config / Files / Apps); hero and quick actions stay pinned.
  Degrades gracefully (all sections remain visible if scripting is unavailable).

### Visual design
- Neutralized the palette (calmer neutrals in light, neutral slate in dark),
  flattened the sidebar, softened shadows and spacing, and set comfortable
  typography.
- Added a single global **theme harmonizer** that re-skins every internal page
  (the many pages carrying their own embedded styles) to the design tokens —
  consistent and correct in both light and dark mode.

### Performance
- Preconnect to third-party origins; deferred Chart.js, QRious and the
  per-module script bundle so they no longer block first paint and download in
  parallel.
- Lightweight shell pages (dashboard, hubs, build services, site workspace) skip
  the large per-module script bundle entirely.
- Per-page code-splitting: single-controller pages load only their own module's
  JS (statically verified safe).
- Cached the non-admin dashboard disk-usage computation, which previously ran a
  `du` subprocess per website on every poll.

### Development services
- Integrated a prominent but tasteful **Build Services** area (sidebar entry,
  dashboard card, empty-state prompts, and an in-panel landing page) linking to
  the development services on cyberpanel.net, with per-service deep links and
  UTM tracking.
- Advertised the managed **Email Delivery** service via a banner on the Email
  hub and a header notification.

### Documentation
- Added `docs/UI-Guide.md` documenting the new interface for administrators,
  resellers and website owners.

## v2.4.7 (build 7) — 2026-05-19

### Dashboard UI/UX overhaul
- Extracted the large inline shell/dashboard CSS into cached static
  stylesheets (`cyberpanel-ui.css`, `dashboard.css`) and fixed
  cache-busting to track the real application version.
- Self-hosted the panel logo (no more third-party hot-link).
- Completed the dark theme so cards, tables, modals, pagination and the
  activity board switch correctly — not just the shell.
- Added usage-threshold colors (green/amber/red) to CPU/RAM/Disk bars,
  loading skeletons, and an error/retry state for system metrics.
- Replaced the fake "demo data" shown while SSH logins load with a
  proper skeleton.

### Navigation & layout
- Replaced the three stacked promo banners with a single header
  notification center (bell + dropdown, per-item dismiss, "dismiss
  all"); removed the layout shift they caused.
- Added a sidebar quick-filter search and a breadcrumb / page-context
  strip.
- Decluttered the shell: flat sidebar items, quiet section labels,
  trimmed header; neutralized the palette and lightened chrome for a
  cleaner look.
- Insight cards are now real links to their list pages.

### Accessibility & i18n
- Semantic landmarks, visible focus styles, ARIA tablist, skip link,
  reduced-motion support, SSH-activity modal focus trap + Esc-to-close.
- Full translation pass over the dashboard strings.

### Performance
- Deferred all external scripts (Angular bootstrap order preserved) to
  cut render-blocking on every page.

### Other
- Standardized UI feedback helpers (`cpToast`, `cpBusy`).
- Responsive dashboard tables on small screens.
- Continued API authorization and security hardening.
