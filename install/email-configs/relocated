# RELOCATED(5)                                                      RELOCATED(5)
# 
# NAME
#        relocated - Postfix relocated table format
# 
# SYNOPSIS
#        postmap /etc/postfix/relocated
# 
# DESCRIPTION
#        The  optional  relocated(5) table provides the information
#        that is used in "user has moved  to  new_location"  bounce
#        messages.
# 
#        Normally,  the  relocated(5)  table is specified as a text
#        file that serves as input to the postmap(1) command.   The
#        result,  an  indexed file in dbm or db format, is used for
#        fast searching by the mail  system.  Execute  the  command
#        "postmap  /etc/postfix/relocated"  to  rebuild  an indexed
#        file after changing the corresponding relocated table.
# 
#        When the table is provided via other means  such  as  NIS,
#        LDAP  or  SQL,  the  same lookups are done as for ordinary
#        indexed files.
# 
#        Alternatively, the table can be  provided  as  a  regular-
#        expression map where patterns are given as regular expres-
#        sions, or lookups can be directed to TCP-based server.  In
#        those  case,  the lookups are done in a slightly different
#        way as described below under "REGULAR  EXPRESSION  TABLES"
#        or "TCP-BASED TABLES".
# 
#        Table lookups are case insensitive.
# 
# CASE FOLDING
#        The  search  string is folded to lowercase before database
#        lookup. As of Postfix 2.3, the search string is  not  case
#        folded  with database types such as regexp: or pcre: whose
#        lookup fields can match both upper and lower case.
# 
# TABLE FORMAT
#        The input format for the postmap(1) command is as follows:
# 
#        o      An entry has one of the following form:
# 
#                    pattern      new_location
# 
#               Where  new_location  specifies  contact information
#               such as an  email  address,  or  perhaps  a  street
#               address or telephone number.
# 
#        o      Empty  lines and whitespace-only lines are ignored,
#               as are lines whose first  non-whitespace  character
#               is a `#'.
# 
#        o      A  logical  line starts with non-whitespace text. A
#               line that starts with whitespace continues a  logi-
#               cal line.
# 
# TABLE SEARCH ORDER
#        With lookups from indexed files such as DB or DBM, or from
#        networked tables such as NIS, LDAP or  SQL,  patterns  are
#        tried in the order as listed below:
# 
#        user@domain
#               Matches  user@domain. This form has precedence over
#               all other forms.
# 
#        user   Matches user@site when site is $myorigin, when site
#               is listed in $mydestination, or when site is listed
#               in $inet_interfaces or $proxy_interfaces.
# 
#        @domain
#               Matches other addresses in domain.  This  form  has
#               the lowest precedence.
# 
# ADDRESS EXTENSION
#        When a mail address localpart contains the optional recip-
#        ient delimiter (e.g., user+foo@domain), the  lookup  order
#        becomes: user+foo@domain, user@domain, user+foo, user, and
#        @domain.
# 
# REGULAR EXPRESSION TABLES
#        This section describes how the table lookups  change  when
#        the  table  is given in the form of regular expressions or
#        when lookups are directed to a  TCP-based  server.  For  a
#        description of regular expression lookup table syntax, see
#        regexp_table(5) or pcre_table(5). For a description of the
#        TCP client/server table lookup protocol, see tcp_table(5).
#        This feature is not available up to and including  Postfix
#        version 2.4.
# 
#        Each  pattern  is  a regular expression that is applied to
#        the entire address being looked up. Thus, user@domain mail
#        addresses  are  not  broken up into their user and @domain
#        constituent parts, nor is user+foo broken up into user and
#        foo.
# 
#        Patterns  are applied in the order as specified in the ta-
#        ble, until a pattern is  found  that  matches  the  search
#        string.
# 
#        Results  are  the  same as with indexed file lookups, with
#        the additional feature that parenthesized substrings  from
#        the pattern can be interpolated as $1, $2 and so on.
# 
# TCP-BASED TABLES
#        This  section  describes how the table lookups change when
#        lookups are directed to a TCP-based server. For a descrip-
#        tion of the TCP client/server lookup protocol, see tcp_ta-
#        ble(5).  This feature is not available up to and including
#        Postfix version 2.4.
# 
#        Each lookup operation uses the entire address once.  Thus,
#        user@domain mail addresses are not broken  up  into  their
#        user and @domain constituent parts, nor is user+foo broken
#        up into user and foo.
# 
#        Results are the same as with indexed file lookups.
# 
# BUGS
#        The table format does not understand quoting  conventions.
