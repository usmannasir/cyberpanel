# GENERIC(5)                                                          GENERIC(5)
# 
# NAME
#        generic - Postfix generic table format
# 
# SYNOPSIS
#        postmap /etc/postfix/generic
# 
#        postmap -q "string" /etc/postfix/generic
# 
#        postmap -q - /etc/postfix/generic <inputfile
# 
# DESCRIPTION
#        The optional generic(5) table specifies an address mapping
#        that applies when mail is delivered. This is the  opposite
#        of  canonical(5)  mapping,  which  applies  when  mail  is
#        received.
# 
#        Typically, one would use the generic(5) table on a  system
#        that  does  not have a valid Internet domain name and that
#        uses  something  like  localdomain.local   instead.    The
#        generic(5)  table  is  then  used by the smtp(8) client to
#        transform local mail addresses into  valid  Internet  mail
#        addresses  when  mail  has to be sent across the Internet.
#        See the EXAMPLE section at the end of this document.
# 
#        The  generic(5)  mapping  affects  both   message   header
#        addresses (i.e. addresses that appear inside messages) and
#        message envelope addresses  (for  example,  the  addresses
#        that are used in SMTP protocol commands).
# 
#        Normally, the generic(5) table is specified as a text file
#        that serves as  input  to  the  postmap(1)  command.   The
#        result,  an  indexed file in dbm or db format, is used for
#        fast searching by the mail  system.  Execute  the  command
#        "postmap  /etc/postfix/generic" to rebuild an indexed file
#        after changing the corresponding text file.
# 
#        When the table is provided via other means  such  as  NIS,
#        LDAP  or  SQL,  the  same lookups are done as for ordinary
#        indexed files.
# 
#        Alternatively, the table can be  provided  as  a  regular-
#        expression map where patterns are given as regular expres-
#        sions, or lookups can be directed to TCP-based server.  In
#        those  case,  the lookups are done in a slightly different
#        way as described below under "REGULAR  EXPRESSION  TABLES"
#        or "TCP-BASED TABLES".
# 
# CASE FOLDING
#        The  search  string is folded to lowercase before database
#        lookup. As of Postfix 2.3, the search string is  not  case
#        folded  with database types such as regexp: or pcre: whose
#        lookup fields can match both upper and lower case.
# 
# TABLE FORMAT
#        The input format for the postmap(1) command is as follows:
# 
#        pattern result
#               When  pattern matches a mail address, replace it by
#               the corresponding result.
# 
#        blank lines and comments
#               Empty lines and whitespace-only lines are  ignored,
#               as  are  lines whose first non-whitespace character
#               is a `#'.
# 
#        multi-line text
#               A logical line starts with non-whitespace  text.  A
#               line  that starts with whitespace continues a logi-
#               cal line.
# 
# TABLE SEARCH ORDER
#        With lookups from indexed files such as DB or DBM, or from
#        networked  tables  such  as NIS, LDAP or SQL, patterns are
#        tried in the order as listed below:
# 
#        user@domain address
#               Replace user@domain by address. This form  has  the
#               highest precedence.
# 
#        user address
#               Replace  user@site by address when site is equal to
#               $myorigin, when site is listed  in  $mydestination,
#               or   when  it  is  listed  in  $inet_interfaces  or
#               $proxy_interfaces.
# 
#        @domain address
#               Replace other addresses in domain by address.  This
#               form has the lowest precedence.
# 
# RESULT ADDRESS REWRITING
#        The lookup result is subject to address rewriting:
# 
#        o      When  the  result  has  the  form @otherdomain, the
#               result becomes the same user in otherdomain.
# 
#        o      When "append_at_myorigin=yes", append  "@$myorigin"
#               to addresses without "@domain".
# 
#        o      When "append_dot_mydomain=yes", append ".$mydomain"
#               to addresses without ".domain".
# 
# ADDRESS EXTENSION
#        When a mail address localpart contains the optional recip-
#        ient  delimiter  (e.g., user+foo@domain), the lookup order
#        becomes: user+foo@domain, user@domain, user+foo, user, and
#        @domain.
# 
#        The   propagate_unmatched_extensions   parameter  controls
#        whether an unmatched address extension  (+foo)  is  propa-
#        gated to the result of table lookup.
# 
# REGULAR EXPRESSION TABLES
#        This  section  describes how the table lookups change when
#        the table is given in the form of regular expressions. For
#        a  description  of regular expression lookup table syntax,
#        see regexp_table(5) or pcre_table(5).
# 
#        Each pattern is a regular expression that  is  applied  to
#        the entire address being looked up. Thus, user@domain mail
#        addresses are not broken up into their  user  and  @domain
#        constituent parts, nor is user+foo broken up into user and
#        foo.
# 
#        Patterns are applied in the order as specified in the  ta-
#        ble,  until  a  pattern  is  found that matches the search
#        string.
# 
#        Results are the same as with indexed  file  lookups,  with
#        the  additional feature that parenthesized substrings from
#        the pattern can be interpolated as $1, $2 and so on.
# 
# TCP-BASED TABLES
#        This section describes how the table lookups  change  when
#        lookups are directed to a TCP-based server. For a descrip-
#        tion of the TCP client/server lookup protocol, see tcp_ta-
#        ble(5).  This feature is not available up to and including
#        Postfix version 2.4.
# 
#        Each lookup operation uses the entire address once.  Thus,
#        user@domain  mail  addresses  are not broken up into their
#        user and @domain constituent parts, nor is user+foo broken
#        up into user and foo.
# 
#        Results are the same as with indexed file lookups.
# 
# EXAMPLE
#        The  following  shows  a  generic  mapping with an indexed
#        file.  When mail is sent to a remote host via  SMTP,  this
#        replaces  his@localdomain.local  by  his ISP mail address,
#        replaces her@localdomain.local by her  ISP  mail  address,
#        and  replaces  other  local  addresses by his ISP account,
#        with an address extension of +local (this example  assumes
#        that the ISP supports "+" style address extensions).
# 
#        /etc/postfix/main.cf:
#            smtp_generic_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/generic
# 
#        /etc/postfix/generic:
#            his@localdomain.local   hisaccount@hisisp.example
#            her@localdomain.local   heraccount@herisp.example
#            @localdomain.local      hisaccount+local@hisisp.example
# 
#        Execute  the  command "postmap /etc/postfix/generic" when-
#        ever the table is changed.  Instead of hash, some  systems
#        use  dbm database files. To find out what tables your sys-
#        tem supports use the command "postconf -m".
# 
# BUGS
#        The table format does not understand quoting  conventions.
#
